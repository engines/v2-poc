# Given that the packer files provisioner can't set permissions because it runs
# as the user running packer I have to change permissions in a shell
# provisioner. Which is, er, this script!

# In short this changes the file permissions and then uses tar move them into
# the correct place.

chown -R root:root /tmp/files
tar -C /tmp/files -cf - . | tar -C / -xf -

#need to think about ownership of injected files
tar -C /tmp/injections -cf - . | tar -C / -xf -
